# Simple-Porker
"Simple-Porker" is a simple porker game made in Java.

## Feature
"Simple-Porker" allows players to play a simple game of poker.<br>
Hold any number of cards from the five cards, and replace the cards other than the one you hold with other cards to arrange the hands.<br>
That's all there is to it.<br>
Created in reference to the "Granblue Fantasy" mini-game.<br>

## Install
After downloading the zip file, run "Sample.java" in Visual Studio or Visual Stuidio Code, etc.<br>
I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.<br>
All images and sound files are free materials from the Internet. Please do not reuse them for other purposes.<br>

## Requirement
jdk-18.0.1<br>

## Note
All code descriptions, etc., are written in Japanese. Please be careful.
If we have time, I would like to implement a wagering feature where people can bet coins, etc.
I hope you enjoyed it a little.
Thank you!!!!
